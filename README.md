## 💻 Why I Decided to Code It Myself
I wanted to challenge myself to apply what I’ve learned in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building a website from scratch. I chose Astro as the framework to learn something new and explore modern web development practices. Its focus on speed and performance made it perfect for a fast, lightweight portfolio site. 

Instead of using a template, I decided to design, code, and structure everything on my own to strengthen my frontend development skills while also learning new technologies.


## ⚔️ How Does This Relate to Cybersecurity?
Building this website helped me understand how web applications are structured, deployed, and optimized, which are all key areas in cybersecurity. Many modern cyber attacks target websites, so learning the technologies behind it gives me a stronger foundation for identifying vulnerabilities and implementing secure coding practices.
